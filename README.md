### Introduction

This library contains all sorts of DB utilities like:

* Optimistic Concurrency Retry
* JPA SQL statement count validator

### Are you struggling with application performance issues?

I could help you get the most out of your data access layer.

If you are interested in on-site training, I can offer you my [High-Performance Java Persistence training](https://vladmihalcea.com/trainings/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dbutil)
which can be adapted to one, two or three days of sessions. For more details, check out [my website](https://vladmihalcea.com/trainings/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dbutil).

If you want me to review your application and provide insight into how you can optimize it to run faster, 
then check out my [consulting page](https://vladmihalcea.com/consulting/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dbutil).

If you want the fastest way to learn how to speed up a Java database application, then you should definitely enroll in [my High-Performance Java Persistence video courses](https://vladmihalcea.com/courses/?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dbutil).

Or, if you prefer reading books, you are going to love my [High-Performance Java Persistence book](https://vladmihalcea.com/books/high-performance-java-persistence?utm_source=GitHub&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=dbutil) as well.
